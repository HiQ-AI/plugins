# Nora — organization Wiki

For teams that need answers grounded in their own published project notes, procedures and decisions.

## What it does

Search and browse published pages; read exact revisions, links and source references; synthesize an answer with traceable citations.

## Install the plugin

In Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add HiQ-AI/plugins
```

```text
/plugin install cortex-org-wiki@hiq-plugins
```

This loads instructions and agent roles, not a CLI, credentials or business data. This repository marketplace is not an official-directory listing. Prepare the CLI separately using [installation and integrity checks](https://github.com/HiQ-AI/plugins/blob/main/docs/INSTALLATION.md).

## Native CLI and requirements

- Plugin version: **0.1.6**.
- CLI executable: `cortex-org-wiki`. CLI version: **0.1.5**.
- Catalog platforms: `darwin-arm64, darwin-x64, linux-arm64, linux-x64, win32-x64`. Missing platforms are unsupported by this catalog.
- Exact archive URLs, SHA256 and executable/skill paths: [release catalog](https://github.com/HiQ-AI/plugins/blob/main/marketplace.json).

Use the CLI's device login and confirm the intended organization membership. It reads published knowledge; installation grants no access to private materials.

Start with the matching CLI's version and help. Do not guess commands or assume installation means readiness. Native Claude Code plugin installation does not interpret Cortex CLI provisioning fields. Codex marketplace adaptation has not been tested; production Desktop has not switched to this source. See [host compatibility](https://github.com/HiQ-AI/plugins/blob/main/docs/COMPATIBILITY.md).

## Limits and side effects

This plugin does not create/publish Wiki pages, approve processes or notify people. Source links can require their own authorization; do not treat them as public downloads.

Use only authorized input, preserve originals, keep credentials out of conversations and inspect actual receipts/readback. Do not blindly repeat an uncertain write. [Shared capability and permission boundaries](https://github.com/HiQ-AI/plugins/blob/main/docs/CAPABILITIES.md) apply.

> Find our published procedure for supplier assessment and cite the page versions supporting the answer.

## Workbook tasks

Workbook inspection or editing may need a separate spreadsheet capability actually available and properly licensed in the host. This plugin does not bundle or automatically install one. Anthropic's [official XLSX skill](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/main/skills/xlsx/SKILL.md) and [its license](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/main/skills/xlsx/LICENSE.txt) are references, not proof of installation or redistribution rights. If unavailable, explain the specific gap and request CSV/JSON only where adequate; do not imply it preserves all workbook features. See [spreadsheet dependencies](https://github.com/HiQ-AI/plugins/blob/main/docs/SPREADSHEETS.md).
